//  Explicitily write down the steps you will take (like a pseudo code) - this forces you to think about the code before you write it.

// The same problem from the last point - // Problem - Write a function that takes an input and returns counts of each character in a string.

function charCount(str)
{
    // make object to return at end
    // loop over string, for each character 
    // if the char is a number/letter and a key in the object, add one to count
    // if char is is a number/letter and not in object, add it and set its value to 1.
    // if char is space, special character etc dont do anyhthing.
    // return an object with keys that are lowercase alphanumeric characters in a string. values should be their corresponding occurences.
